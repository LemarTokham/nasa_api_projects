### Learning how to use APIs and experimenting with NASAs APIs ###
For now, running the code will generate image files of pictures taken by the various Mars rovers

### Different parts of the program ###
rover.py will output the images taken on sol 1000 of mars into .jpg files

apod.py will out the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" into .jpg files, with the image being different each day
In apod.py you can enter in your own custom date to see what was the picture of the day in your specified date. Must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and must be after 1995-06-16.

custom_rover.py allows you to enter a custom date and get an image of the picture taken on that date by the curiosity mars rover. (Must be from when the rover landed, which is 2012-08-06, when the rover took it's first image. How cool!!!)
